#Welcome to Iroha documentation localisation folder!

It is great you've decided to take some time to contribute into documentation translation.


Here is how it works:

1. You take the docs forlder from the Iroha submodule right in the branch that corresponds to the version you would like to use;
2. You translate the `docs` folder (just copy it and modify in any editor of your choice!)
3. Put the `docs` with translations into the `locale` folder under the folder with your language code (if you need help with that, please, contact the [maintainers](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/1.2.0-rc.2#need-help))

After it's done, contact the maintainers again to make sure the translation is activated to appear in our online documentation!
